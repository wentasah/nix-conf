  # Despite enabling services.avahi.nssmdns, I often (but not always)
  # got "Impossible to connect to XXX.local: Name or service not
  # known". It turns out that the cause is long mDNS delay. By default
  # NixOS uses mdns NSS module, which tries to resolve both IPv4 and
  # IPv6 addresses sequentially. It seems to start with IPv6, which
  # does not resolve so after 5s timeout the resolution continues with
  # IPv4. So the address of the printer is returned after slightly
  # more that 5 seconds, which seems to be too long for CUPS so it
  # gives up and tries again later and the same repeats, because nscd
  # in NixOS does not cache the results.
  #
  # The solution is to use mdns4 instead of mdns NSS module.
